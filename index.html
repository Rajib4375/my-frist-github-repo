    <!-- <img class="cover" src="sylhet cover.jpg" alt="">  -->
    <p>Sylhet is one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh. It's a place of natural beauty. Sylhet is widely known for having tea gardens and hills. It is also a holy place as it is known as the place of 360 awlias(saints). Last year I got the opportunity to go to Sylhet. I visited Sylhet with my family. We went there by train. I sat beside the window and enjoy the scenes through the window. I was overwhelmed by the natural scenes. After seven hours long journey, we reached Sylhet. We visited all the places of tourist attractions like- Jaflong which is near the Indian border, Ratargul swamp forest, Lauachara forest, and Tangua Haor. We spent five days in Sylhet. I enjoyed each and every moments of my Sylhet tour.</p>
            <h3>Shah Poran Mazar Sylhet</h3>
            <img src="shahporan mazar.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Hazrat Shah Paran was a Sufi saint of the Suhrawardiyya and Jalalia order. It is said that he was the son of a sister of Shah Jalal and was born in Hadramaut, Yemen. He was an accomplice of his uncle, Shah Jalal, with whom he arrived in India. In 1303 AD, He took part in the expedition of Sylhet which was led by Shah Jalal. After the conquest of Sylhet he established a khanqah at Khadim Nagar in Dakshingarh Pargana, about 7 km away from Sylhet town, where he started Sufi spiritual practices and activities. He played a significant role in propagating Islam and establishing Muslim rule in the Sylhet region.

                It is unclear how and when he died, but he is buried near his khanqah. For centuries, large numbers of devotees have been visiting his tomb, a practice which continues even today. On the 4th, 5th and 6th day of Rabi-ul-Awal, the Urs of Hazrat Shah Paran takes place. His grave is located in a high hillock and it is carefully preserved at a place which is built with bricks and surrounded by walls. On the northern side of the grave there is an old tree, the branches and branchlets of which are extended above the entire tomb.</p>

            <img width="1200px" src="shahjalal mazar.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Shah Jalal ad-Din al-Mujarrad al Naqshbandi, popularly known as Hazrat Shah Jalal (1271 – 1346) is a much loved Sufi saint in Bangladesh. Born Shaikh Makhdum Jalal ad-Deen bin Mohammed, he was later affectionately renamed Shaikh-ul-Mashaikh Hazrat Shah Jalal al-Mujarrad (the last name meaning "the bachelor", on account of his celibacy).

                Shah Jalal's date and place of birth are unclear. Various traditions and folklore suggest different possibilities. A number of scholars claim he was born in 1271 in Konya, Turkey, the son of a Turkish Muslim cleric, who was a contemporary of the famous Persian poet and Sufi saint Rumi. Shah Jalal was educated and raised by his maternal uncle, Syed Ahmed Kabir, in Mecca. He excelled in his studies, became a Hafiz (one who has committed the Qur'an to memory), and achieved Kamaliyat (spiritual perfection) after 30 years of learning and meditation. His biography was first recorded in the mid 16th century by Shaikh 'Ali (died 1562), a descendant of one of Shah Jalal's companions. According to Shaikh 'Ali's account, Shah Jalal was born in Turkestan in Central Asia, where he became a spiritual disciple of Saiyid Ahmad Yasawi, one of the founders of the Central Asian Sufi tradition.</p>
